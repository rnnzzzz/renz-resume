<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>I am a highly active and disciplined individual who prioritizes 
personal growth through physical and outdoor activities. 
I sometimes engage in hiking, swimming, biking, and basketball,
which have strengthened my resilience, endurance, mental toughness,
and ability to stay focused on long term goals.
These experiences have shaped my strong work ethic and competitive mindset.

Through sports and outdoor challenges, I have developed teamwork, adaptability,
and the ability to perform under pressure. I value consistency, accountability,
and continuous self improvement, principles that guide both my personal and professional life.

In addition, I am a trained Full Stack Web Developer with a solid foundation
in modern web technologies. I apply the same discipline and growth mindset
from my active lifestyle to building efficient and user focused web applications
while continuously improving my technical expertise.
